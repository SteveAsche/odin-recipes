    <p>Face it, we're all tired of this pandemic.  There's really only one thing that makes sense now. 
        That's eating more!
    </p>
    <p>This brownie recipe is dead simple and may, in fact, kill you.</p>
    <p>Good luck, you'll need it</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 bag chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 large chicken eggs</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit)</li>
        <li>It's real simple - <em>"mise en place"</em>. Look it up.  It means assemble all your ingredients and tools before cooking.  Seriously, don't be a noob.</li>
        <li>Bung that sugar, water and butter into a 2 quart saucepan (or whatever you have)</li>
        <li>Heat the sugar, butter, and water over medium heat; stirring constantly, until all the butter and sugar melts</li>
        <li>Once the sugar is just starting to boil, remove from heat</li>
        <li>Add vanilla to molten lava sugar</li>
        <li>Mix half a bag of chocolate chips into molten lava sugar. Stir until it looks like chocolate sludge.</li>
        <li>Bung the chocolate sauce into mixing bowl, preferably you have a mixer</li>
        <li>Start mixing the chocolate sludge in that there mixing bowl on medium speed.  If you don't have a mixer, use a whisk and beat it like a rented mule.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time.  Don't be a knob and forget to crack the eggs.  No one wants eggshells in their brownies.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, baking powder while mixing</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Bung the batter into a greased and floured 8x8 pan</li>
        <li>Cook for 35 minutes</li>
        <li>Cool them before you eat them, ya git</li>

    </ol>
